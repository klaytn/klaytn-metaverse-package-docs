# Introduction

### What is IPFS

IPFS, or InterPlanetary File System, is a decentralized storage and communication protocol that allows users to store and share files and data on the decentralized web. IPFS is built on the principles of distributed networks, content-addressing, and peer-to-peer communication, and enables users to access and share data in a secure, transparent, and scalable way.

### Why is IPFS important for Metaverse?

Metaverse projects store vast amounts of data, including virtual graphics, world maps, and in-game items such as buildings and vehicles. This data is typically stored using centralized storage providers like AWS or Google Cloud, which can cause outages if these providers experience downtime.

On the blockchain, we need decentralized storage options like Arweave or IPFS to store their assets. Additionally, data stored on decentralized storage networks is typically private, unlike IPFS, where all data is publicly accessible through its content identifier (CID) value.
