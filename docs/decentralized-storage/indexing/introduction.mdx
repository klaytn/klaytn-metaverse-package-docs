## What are Indexes? <a id="What is an Index"></a>

[**Indexes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index) speed up the retrieval of data by reducing the number of reads required to find said data, often in *logarithmic* scales.
*E.g.*: to find an item in 1000 data points, indexes may only need 10 reads; in 1,000,000 data points, only 20 reads are needed.

**Indexes** can also organize data in a way that makes it easier to find specific data, like how books, search engines, & websites index topics (including this website!);
With Indexes, searches that take *minutes* can be reduced to *milliseconds* üëá.

## Why index Decentralized Storages? <a id="Why index Decentralized Storages"></a>

Blockchain data is stored in a distributed & sequential manner, which makes data retrieval *complex & slow*.

A common use case for [Real-World Assets](https://klaytn.foundation/from-traditional-to-digitalexploring-the-potential-and-power-of-rwa-tokenization) is tracing an NFT's origin. Without an index, you would need to scan through blocks one by one to find the transaction that created the NFT. If 1 million new transactions have been created since the NFT was minted, 1 million transactions need to be scanned; A slow & expensive operation is performed to retrieve a single line of data.

At the basic level, Blockchain Indexing services (or **Indexers**) read data points from the blockchain as they arrive & organize them in a database. When a system or user requests data, the Indexer accesses the database & returns the data to the requester, in logarithmic&nbsp;time&nbsp;‚è±Ô∏è.

Isn't bringing distributed data into a single database... Centralization? Yes, but that's where Decentralized, [Oracle](/docs/category/-decentralized-oracle)-like Indexers come in: indexes are replicated across nodes & proof mechanisms are implemented while maintaining high-speed, low-cost read operations.

Decentralized Indexers enable blockchain's security to scale for üëÜ **lots of data & realtime latency**.
