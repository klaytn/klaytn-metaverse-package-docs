# Overview

### Challenges with blockchain data

Although blockchain is conceptually quite similar to traditional databases, querying databases is completely different from querying a blockchain.First, there are notable performance issues with storing data on the blockchain. This has a lot to do with the distributed nature of blockchain's structure that is time-ordered, the linked data resides across numerous blocks, and because there is no built-in mechanism to identify, categorize, or query it. As a result, an index that allows users to search the Blockchain for specific words would expand its reach, power, and usability.

### Blockchain Indexing Protocols

Indexing is simply a way to efficiently retrieve records from the database based on some attributes on which the indexing has been done. This technique is used to reduce time required to find a particular piece of information. Indexing is used by blockchain indexing protocols, which are mechanism that allow to query and organize the data on the blockchain in a distributed way. Once the data indexed on the blockchain, applications are allowed to query it using open APIs.Indexing protocols are used by developers to query data that is inaccessible directly and to create serverless applications that run purely on public infrastructure.
